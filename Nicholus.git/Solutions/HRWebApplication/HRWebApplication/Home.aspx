        <h3>The Untold Secrets of True Wealth </h3>
    </form>
<div style="background-color:cadetblue">
        <p>First and foremost, you must start unlearning! Below is a list of the most common Myths about Wealth, Money and Success that you MUST unlearn:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>I don't have what it takes to be successful and wealthy.
            <br/>
            <br/>Fact:
            Successful people were not born that way. In fact, many of the most successful people today had very difficult lives.
            They were regular people who wished for more. And they decided to do something about it- to change their circumstances.
            Anyone can do the same, including you and I.
            <br/>
        </li><br/>
        <li>I don't have any experience or education in anything.
            <br/>
            <br/>Fact:
            Many successful people started with no experience. Many of them also flunked high school and never had any college education.
            The only way to get real education and experience in anything is by doing, by "starting". Once you start doing it, you learn very quickly.
            Think of all the things that you know how to do. Driving a car, riding a bike, playing sports, reading, writing, speaking... even walking.
            <br/>
            All of these things have one thing in common: at one time in your life, you didn't know how to do any of them.
            And despite how impossible it seemed at the time, you decided to do it anyway. It's the same with everything in life. You learn by doing.
            You get experience by doing something a few times. Get started. Do it once, twice, three times and you're already on your way to becoming an expert in no time!
         </li><br/>
        <li>
            To be successful, I have to start a business, and I'm just not cut out to be a businessperson. I don't have what it takes.
            <br/>

            <br/>
            <br/>Fact:
        </li><br/>
        <li>Money must be made slowly.
            <br/>
            <br/>Fact:

            <br/>
            <br/>Fact:
        </li><br/>
        <li>
            Having more money will mean that I'll have to work hard all day and not have time for my family, friends and leisure.
            <br/>
            <br/>Fact:
        </li><br/>
        <li>If I have more money, people will judge me, and they will not like me very much.
